- 👋 Hi, I’m @DashTrash-300
- 👀 I’m interested in making the funny computer words do things for me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do that ^
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all the things, it's like getting the smart kid to do your homework except I made the work. It's more like making someone work for free.
you probably shouldn't do that. But if you insist?
